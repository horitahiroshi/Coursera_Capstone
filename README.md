# Coursera Capstone

This is a project created for the [_Applied Data Science Capstone_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone) course from IBM's Data Science professional certificate program on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) platform.

# The Battle of the Neighborhoods

This project will follow the following statement:

>Given a city like the City of Toronto, segment it into different neighborhoods using the geographical coordinates of the center of each neighborhood, and then using a combination of location data and machine learning, group the neighbourhoods into clusters.

<!-- So in summary, this capstone course will consist of five modules. -->
